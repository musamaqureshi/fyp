### Final Project Proposal


There will be three tabs which is one of them includes login screen, the other one includes sign up screen and the final tab will show profile. In sign up screen database will hold the information of users and when users login tab 3 will show the profile of user. Profile tab will includes the information of user except password. User can update login information or delete his/her profile from database with buttons. There will be an admin also and admin is able to see other users information in his/her screen in a listview and can delete them. Database will remember admin’s nickname and password so it will show the profile which includes other users information.
